```This rice is very clean, its all configured in only 1 directory. ```

# installation (idk if finished)
```
nix run nixpkgs#python3 -- ./install.py

```

## random tips!
- use pypy3 instead of Cpython3, its faster
- your rice should be reproducible, so you can use it everywhere on any device.
- use fabric as your widgets if you like python :} (https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric)
- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ or you can use quickshell if you like JS and QT

## it's kind of bad rn in looks, but i will add more things soon.
  | TODO     |
